# Booking Creation Flow - Multiple Layers of Protection

## Problem
Bookings were not being created when customers paid via UPI and didn't return to the browser.

## Solution
Multiple layers ensure booking is created regardless of customer behavior:

## Layer 1: Razorpay Handler Callback (Client-Side)
**When**: Payment succeeds and customer returns to browser
**Location**: `src/pages/PublicBooking.tsx` - Razorpay handler function
**Action**: Immediately calls `/api/razorpay/reconcile-payment` to reconcile and create booking
**Reliability**: ⚠️ Only works if customer returns to browser

```javascript
handler: async function (response: any) {
  // Tries to reconcile payment immediately when payment succeeds
  await fetch("/api/razorpay/reconcile-payment", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      order_id: response.razorpay_order_id,
      payment_id: response.razorpay_payment_id,
    }),
  });
  // Then redirects to success page
  // Note: Automatic cron will also reconcile within 1 minute if this fails
}
```

## Layer 2: Webhook (Server-Side) - PRIMARY METHOD
**When**: Payment succeeds (regardless of customer behavior)
**Location**: `api/razorpay/webhook.ts`
**Action**: Razorpay sends webhook event, we create booking automatically
**Reliability**: ✅ Works even if customer doesn't return (MUST BE CONFIGURED)

**Configuration Required:**
1. Go to Razorpay Dashboard → Settings → Webhooks
2. Add webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/razorpay/webhook`
3. Subscribe to: `payment.captured`, `order.paid`
4. Set `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable

## Layer 3: Callback Handler (Server-Side)
**When**: Razorpay redirects after payment (if customer returns)
**Location**: `api/razorpay/callback.ts`
**Action**: Awaits booking creation before redirecting
**Reliability**: ⚠️ Only works if customer returns to browser

## Layer 4: Success Page (Client-Side)
**When**: Customer lands on success page
**Location**: `src/pages/PublicPaymentSuccess.tsx`
**Action**: Immediately tries to reconcile payment if it doesn't exist
**Reliability**: ⚠️ Only works if customer returns to browser

```typescript
// Immediately on page load:
await fetch("/api/razorpay/reconcile-payment", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ order_id, payment_id }),
});
// Note: Automatic cron will also reconcile within 1 minute if this fails
```

## API Endpoint: `/api/razorpay/reconcile-payment`
**Purpose**: Verify payment and create booking synchronously
**Location**: `api/razorpay/reconcile-payment.ts`
**Features**:
- Verifies payment status with Razorpay API
- Extracts booking data from pending_payments table
- Creates customer if needed
- Creates booking records
- Idempotent (won't create duplicates)

## Flow Diagram

```
Customer Pays in UPI App
         │
         ├─► Razorpay Processes Payment
         │
         ├─► [Layer 2] Webhook Fires (PRIMARY) ✅
         │   └─► Creates Booking Automatically
         │
         ├─► [Layer 1] Handler Callback (if customer returns)
         │   └─► Creates Booking Immediately
         │
         ├─► [Layer 3] Callback Handler (if customer returns)
         │   └─► Creates Booking Before Redirect
         │
         └─► [Layer 4] Success Page (if customer returns)
             └─► Creates Booking if Missing
```

## Why Multiple Layers?

1. **Webhook (Layer 2)** is the PRIMARY method - works even if customer doesn't return
2. **Handler Callback (Layer 1)** ensures booking is created immediately when customer returns
3. **Callback Handler (Layer 3)** is a server-side backup
4. **Success Page (Layer 4)** is the final safety net

## Testing

### Test 1: Customer Returns to Browser
1. Make payment
2. Return to browser
3. Booking should be created by Layer 1 or Layer 4
4. ✅ Expected: Booking exists

### Test 2: Customer Doesn't Return (KEY TEST)
1. Make payment
2. **Close browser immediately** (don't return)
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Check database
5. ✅ Expected: Booking exists (created by Layer 2 - Webhook)

### Test 3: Webhook Not Configured
1. Make payment
2. Close browser immediately
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Check database
5. ❌ Expected: Booking might NOT exist (webhook not working)

## Troubleshooting

### Booking Not Created When Customer Doesn't Return
**Cause**: Webhook not configured or not receiving events
**Solution**: 
1. Check Razorpay Dashboard → Webhooks → Activity
2. Verify webhook URL is correct
3. Check `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set
4. Test webhook with Razorpay's "Send Test Webhook" feature

### Booking Created Multiple Times
**Cause**: Multiple layers creating booking
**Solution**: This shouldn't happen - all layers check for existing booking first (idempotent)

### Booking Data Missing
**Cause**: Order notes not storing booking data
**Solution**: Check `api/razorpay/create-order.ts` - ensure `bookingData` is being sent

## Key Points

- ✅ **Webhook is PRIMARY** - Must be configured for reliable booking creation
- ✅ **All layers are idempotent** - Won't create duplicate bookings
- ✅ **Multiple safety nets** - Ensures booking is created even if one layer fails
- ⚠️ **Webhook configuration is critical** - Without it, bookings won't be created if customer doesn't return

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Webhook** (CRITICAL):
   - Go to Razorpay Dashboard
   - Add webhook URL
   - Subscribe to events
   - Set webhook secret

2. **Test the Flow**:
   - Make test payment
   - Close browser immediately
   - Verify booking exists in database

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Check webhook activity in Razorpay Dashboard
   - Check server logs for booking creation
   - Verify all layers are working
